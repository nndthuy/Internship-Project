## Topic: Constructing the database of 18S rRNA gene in Nematode
Done by: Nguyen Ngoc Diem Thuy \
ID: BTBTIU20234


I was assigned to build up the custom 18S rRNA gene database for the Nematode ***(plant parasite :microbe:)***  

1. **Data collection** :open_file_folder: \
  18S rRNA gene sequences used for database construction is available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) \
  Detailed information of Nematode and its associated host is available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) 

2. **Validation** :white_check_mark: \
The appreciated sequence is choosen and then aligned by using CLUSTW agorithm to construct [phylogenetic tree](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) 

  
3. **Build database** :desktop_computer: \
The PostgresSQL is used for the construction of databse task. \
Open-source database is availbal [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

5. **Visualization** :bar_chart: \
   The categories and their data are visualized by R. \
   Lick [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to see.
